Radical writing is challenging by nature, but reading with others can help. All the authors and subjects you've heard of but never explored are one friendly introduction away.

Reading groups that meet in person are well-intentioned, but they're difficult to schedule. They also tend — like bureaucratic political meetings — to favour people in privileged positions. If you have dependents or other demands on your time, chances are high that a reading group is one obligation too many.

Radical Reading Club is a welcoming online space for you to read radical left material with your comrades. Low-commitment, free of tedious soapboxing, equal parts fun and theory.
