## Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as participants pledge to make our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of your comrades' viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards comrades, even during difficult or heated discussions
* Encouraging participation regardless of levels of commitment or availability

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* Using this community for sectarian grandstanding or bad faith readings of other people's views
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances

## Our responsibilities

Administrators or moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any person for behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to online discussion and any spaces in which the community is being represented. Examples include promoting the group online or in person, or inviting others to join. Comrades are expected to vouch for any people they invite to join.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting admin@radicalreading.club. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Administrators or moderators are obliged to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4, with various amendments which make it more appropriate to a political reading group than an open source software project.
